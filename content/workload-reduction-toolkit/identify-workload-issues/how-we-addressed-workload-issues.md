  <p>
    We formed our
    <%= link_to("Trust Workload and Wellbeing group", "https://www.heartsacademytrust.co.uk/workload-and-wellbeing") %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Trust we also developed a Workload and Wellbeing Charter which is
    updated each September and mid-year if needed to ensure that messages
    are reinforced. An annual well-being survey also supports schools to
    understand if the charter is effective and being implemented.

## Background from Jane Robinson, Head of School

We took part in a DfE project to address workload by running a trial of new
approaches in school. After discussions with staff, we identified that in-school
communication was driving unnecessary workload and causing additional pressure
on staff, so we decided to make that our focus of change.

## Our tips for addressing workload issues

### Involve everyone

Approach change as a project and appoint someone to lead it. Everyone needs to
feel that they have some ownership of the project and to focus on doing the
things that make most difference to the root of the problem to find workable
solutions.

### Conduct a survey

Encourage everyone to be honest in their responses. We used the
[Staff workload survey](/workload-reduction-toolkit/identify-workload-issues/staff-workload-survey)
in the school workload reduction toolkit and asked staff to complete it
anonymously.

### Hold an INSET session

Include teaching staff - teachers, HLTAs, SLT - to explore the drivers of
workload by discussing the results of the surveys. Debate options for moving
forward, share ideas, consider what seems manageable.

### Decide together how you will assess the success of any change

Make sure that the information collected can be used as measurable results as
this adds weight to the findings. We would consider running a randomised
controlled trial for further change projects.

### Prioritise what action to take

Many areas might be identified but you can’t tackle them all at once. For us, we
prioritised internal communications.

### Explore the workload issue

Once we’d decided to focus on internal communications, we issued an additional
very short 5 question multiple choice survey to dig deeper and staff agreed to
complete a very simple ‘hours worked’ tracker to identify essential and
non-essential activity.

### Monitor implementation and outcomes

We repeated the survey and tracker (in the middle and end of the project)
feeding back to staff, reflecting and adapting as necessary.

### Maximise the outcomes

Share and disseminate what you learn and the actions you take through your
Trust or local networks.

### Communicate with staff

Give and receive feedback throughout. Regular updates, revisits, monitoring are
all needed if the change is to become part of the organisation’s psyche.

### Empower all staff

Hold each other to account for the commitment to workload reduction.

### Create a wellbeing and workload group

Create a group in your school, trust or across local networks. Show the
importance of addressing workload and wellbeing by having a dedicated page on
your website.
