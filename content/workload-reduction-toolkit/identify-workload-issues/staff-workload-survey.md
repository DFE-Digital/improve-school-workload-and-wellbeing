        The survey can be edited to meet the needs of your setting and
        you can add, change or remove questions if required. For
        example, some parts of the survey may be more appropriate for

“The online form made it accessible for staff. The responses were set out in a
range of charts so I could explain clearly to staff what the outcomes were
and indicate areas where we needed to focus”

Claire Evans, Deputy Headteacher
Anderton Park Primary School

## Suggestions for running a successful survey

School leaders who hve conducted staff surveys in their own schools shared the
following suggestions for running a successful survey:

### Decide when and how often to run the survey

Consider when in the school year it would be best to run your staff survey for
it to have the most impact and allow you to act on the results. Carrying out
regular surveys will allow you to evaluate the impact that your actions are
having on staff workload, for example, some schools run these annually.

### Decide who to survey and how long it will run for

You could choose the survey a group of staff, for example middle leaders or
teaching assistants and edit the survey to reflect their role.

You should edit the survey to explain to staff how long the survey will remain
open for.

### Decide whether you need to anonymise the survey

An anonymous survey may encourage more accurate responses from the staff who
take part. If you want to understand differences in workload between teams or
groups, questions about name and role can be added.

### Decide what to do next

You will need to consider the sequence of how you will act on the results of
your staff survey. Give yourself time to analyse the results, update your staff
and take action.

You can use the [acting on your staff survey presentation](/workload-reduction-toolkit/identify-workload-issues/act-on-your-staff-survey)
to update your staff and get their input on your next steps.

The workload survey has been structured to align with the Identify, Address and
Evaluate tookit areas. You can address workload issues you identify using
resources from this toolkit, however the list is not exhaustive. You can help
other school leaders by [sharing what has worked in your school](/share-your-ideas).
