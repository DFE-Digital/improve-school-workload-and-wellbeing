## Adapt the template

Edit the template to better reflect your school.

Some school leaders might use the staff workload survey first and then
personalise this structured conversation template based on the results.

## Decide when you’ll have the conversations

Consider when in the school year it would be best to have structured
conversations.

Some school leaders find it helpful to repeat conversations later, to evaluate
the impact their actions are having on staff workload.

## Decide who will be involved in the conversations

Consider who should lead the structured conversations. It might be an activity
to delegate to year group or subject leads.

Decide who should participate in the conversations. They could be through
one-to-one conversations or groups with staff members from different roles.

## Plan your next steps

Consider how you will act on the results of the conversations. Give yourself
time to analyse the results, update your staff and act.

Once you’ve had the structured conversations, decide what actions you need to
take either during the sessions or afterwards. Some of the resources in the
[Address workload issues](/workload-reduction-toolkit/address-workload-issues/)
section might help you with any issues identified. However, the list is not
exhaustive. You can help other school leaders by sharing what has worked in your
school.
