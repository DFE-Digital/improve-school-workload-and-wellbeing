## Background from Neil Cully, Headteacher

{inset-text}

Notre Dame High School [created a wellbeing committee](/staff-wellbeing/establish-a-wellbeing-committee)
that issued a workload survey to its staff. They used the results to create an
action plan which focuses on improving staff wellbeing and reducing workload.

The action plan outlines the key areas of focus, the actions that need to be
taken, what success looks like and the timescale for actions to be taken.

## Creating an action plan

When you create your action plan, Notre Dame High School advise the following:

### Identify the action planâ€™s objectives

Identify one, or at most two, things that you are going to do to help issues
prioritised from the workload survey.

### Decide your actions

Work out what you are going to do to reach your objectives.

### Determine your success criteria

Determine how you will know those actions have been achieved, and that you have
succeeded.

### Decide a time scale for completion of actions

Decide how long you think the above will take you. Note any important milestones
to include if the timescale is longer, for example, over the whole year.

### Work out what resources you will need

Decide what additional support you will need to achieve the objectives. For
example, additional time for staff to research new ideas or funding for
training.

### Decide who is responsible for monitoring progress

This could be one person or group. For example, your senior leadership team or
wellbeing committee.

### Evaluate and decide any further outcomes

When you have completed the actions on your plan, [evaluate how they went](/workload-reduction-toolkit/evaluate-workload-measures/).
For example, re-run the workload survey you used to identify the initial issues.
This evaluation and any further actions should be discussed and agreed with all
staff.

## Consider these questions when creating an action plan

Notre Dame High School considered the following questions when creating their
action plan:

- Who are we doing this for?
- Will it improve the quality of teaching?
- What impact will it have on students?
- Can we do this in a more efficient and effective way?
