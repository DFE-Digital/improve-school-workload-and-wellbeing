## Audience

This resource has been provided to support senior leadership teams to work with
the whole school, teams or departments.

## Presentation length

1 hour 15 minutes. You should also allocate time for the facilitator to prepare
the session for use in your school.

## How to run with your staffâ€¯

Use this presentation to map out your school year, considering how it impacts on
workload. Decide if elements can be streamlined, removed, or can take place at a
different time of year.

When adding to the calendar keep asking the question: If I do this at this point
in the year, what will be the impact on workload? If the impact is high, then
reconsider the timings.

At the end of your session, you should decide how actions are recorded and
reviewed, who is responsible, and how you will communicate changes with staff,
governors, pupils and parents or carers.

Decide whether the exercise will be completed individually, in teams or
departments, before discussing together.

Senior leadership teams are likely to want to oversee the process, they could
also consider if it is more appropriate for another member of staff to
facilitate the session and lead on follow-up, for example, a head of department.

You might also wish to consider asking somebody independent to facilitate the
workshop to free up time to take part.

The key to success is providing a supportive environment for open and honest
professional dialogue.
