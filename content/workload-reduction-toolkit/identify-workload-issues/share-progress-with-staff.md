## How to use the table to share progress with staff

Use the table to share the workload issues you have identified in your school
and the actions you plan to take to reduce workload.

The template follows the ‘we discovered, we did, we found’ format:

### ‘We discovered’

These are the workload issues you have identified in your school based on your
staff’s views.

### ‘We did’

These are the actions you plan to take to address the issues you identified.

You can use the [Address workload issues](/workload-reduction-toolkit/address-workload-issues/)
section of the workload reduction toolkit to help address specific workload
issues. It may be helpful to include who is responsible and date targets for
each action.

### ‘We found’

Once you have addressed a workload issue, speak with your staff again to assess
how their workload and views have changed.

You can use the [Evaluate workload meaures](/workload-reduction-toolkit/evaluate-workload-measures/)
section of the workload reduction toolkit to help you evaluate and monitor the
impact of your workload reduction measures.
