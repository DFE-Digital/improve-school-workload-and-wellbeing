        Impact and outcomes
      </h2>
      <p>
        We have relentlessly removed unnecessary tasks or reduced them to their
        essential components, especially when the justification for doing them
        was ‘that’s what everyone else does’ or ‘that’s what OFSTED, DfE or some
        other body want. The marking policy (now included in this service’s
        school workload reduction toolkit) was one outcome of this wider work.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, in our most recent wellbeing survey, 95% of our staff
        believed they completed their work ‘on time’ and, consequently, over 70%
        answered ‘very much so’ to the question: do you have a life outside
        work?

## Background from Ben Levinson, Headteacher

At Kensington, reducing workload has been an obsession from day one. This INSET
day was entitled ‘What gets in the way of teaching?’.

We have been through countless iterations since and it has been a key component
in the development of our culture and ethos.

It is borne from two beliefs:

- teaching 30 children, 5 lessons per day, 5 days per week, is a full-time job
  in itself
- inspiring teachers have the time and energy to focus on what matters and have
  a life outside of school

## Create an agenda for the INSET day

The agenda for the first INSET day was simple:

Staff worked in groups to come up with a list of the things that get in the way
of them doing the best possible job of teaching our pupils.

They looked at a ‘long list’ of the school’s initiatives. For example, things
like how we teach reading or mark pupils’ work, the housepoints system,
attendance initiatives, interventions.

They then decided what worked and what didn’t.

We then categorised these and worked to remove everything that didn’t have a
direct impact on our pupils.

## Act on what you find out

Inevitably, marking was a key part of this. Our approach to marking was based on
research from the likes of the Education Endowment Foundation and John Hattie.
So we encouraged and supported staff to mark more in the lesson – as immediate
feedback can have a greater impact. We also ensured that marking was there for
the children, not for myself, my senior team, or anyone else.

This marking policy was one outcome of this wider work.

## Follow up with staff

We followed up the INSET day with a simple ‘We said, We did’ table to show that
we had listened and acted to remove the barriers to effective teaching.
