## Adapt the template

Edit the template to better reflect your school.

Some school leaders customise this structured conversation template based on the results of their staff workload survey,
or prior structured conversations with staff.

## Decide when youâ€™ll have the conversations

Consider when in the school year it would be best to have structured conversations.

Some school leaders find it helpful to have multiple structured conversations throughout the year, to continue evaluating
the impact of their workload reduction measures.

## Decide who will be involved in the conversations

Consider who should:

- lead the conversations, which could be delegated to year group or subject leads
- participate in the conversations, which could be one-on-one or held in a group involving staff members from different roles

You could also consider repeating the conversations with the same lead and participants from prior structured discussions.

## Plan your next steps

Consider how you will act on the results of the conversations. Give yourself time to analyse the results, update your staff
and act.
