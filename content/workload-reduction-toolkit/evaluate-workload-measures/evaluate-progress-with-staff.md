# Evaluate outcomes and share progress with staff

<strong class="govuk-tag">Template</strong>

Use this template to show your staff the actions you have taken, or will take, to address workload issues identified in
your school. Gather feedback and evaluate if any actions taken have had an impact on their workload.

## How to use the table to evaluate outcomes

You can use the table to identify and measure the impact of any actions you take to reduce workload in your school.  

The template follows the ‘we discovered, we did, we found’ format:

### 'We discovered'

These are the workload issues you have identified in your school based on your staff’s views. You can use the
[Identify section](/workload-reduction-toolkit/identify-workload-issues) of the workload reduction toolkit to identify
and prioritise the issues that are most important to your staff.

### 'We did'

These are the actions you plan to take, or have already taken, to address the issues you identified.

The [Address section](/workload-reduction-toolkit/address-workload-issues) of the workload reduction toolkit may be
useful to address any specific workload issues you continue to identify as you gather feedback.

### 'We found'

Once you have addressed a workload issue, speak with your staff again to assess how their workload and views have changed.

Depending on the outcome of your actions, you can use the toolkit and this template to continue to identify, address and
evaluate workload issues.
