          How to run with your staff
        </h2>

        <p>
          The workshop is designed for senior leadership teams to facilitate with their staff across the whole school, teams or departments about expectations for planning. It allows staff to assess what works within the current system and decide what needs to be discussed further to remove unnecessary burdens and reduce workload.  
        </p>
        <p>
          You can extend the timings to allow for deeper discussion and identification of action. Feedback from each session can be by whole group discussion, flipcharts, points or post-its. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussion will be stimulated by actual examples of the various forms of long, medium or short-term planning in your school. Have photocopied examples ready for each group.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask staff before the workshop to bring examples of their current schemes of work and lesson plans or have some available to stimulate discussion. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Senior leadership teams are likely to want to oversee the process. They could also consider if it is more appropriate for another member of staff to facilitate the session and lead on follow-up, for example, a head of department. Alternatively, you might wish to consider asking somebody independent to facilitate the workshop to free up time to take part. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide a supportive environment for open and honest professional
          dialogue.
