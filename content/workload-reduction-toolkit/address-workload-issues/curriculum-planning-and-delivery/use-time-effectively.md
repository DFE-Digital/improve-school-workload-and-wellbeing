## Background from headteacher Julie Kelly 

{inset-text}
Being a small school means that we have to strategically plan how to manage all the various roles every school has to undertake.  

We have to ensure that all roles and responsibilities are covered whilst creating and maintaining a sustainable workload for each member of staff. 

Our ethos is one of collaboration within and across schools, so even if the staff are working on their own, they know they can call on support.

## Use time effectively 

### Invest in technology  

We invested in education technology and curriculum resources that support a knowledge-rich curriculum. 

We are not persuaded by hard sales techniques and invest only to meet our needs. 

### Use existing resources  

We use existing evidence-informed materials, such as materials from Oak National Academy, the Education Endowment Foundation, White Rose Education and Rising Stars. 

### Prioritise  

When reviewing our curriculum, we do not try to do everything at once.  

We review core subjects every year, and foundation subjects every 3 years.  

### Create a proforma or outline for teachers to refer to 

We give teachers a proforma or outline to refer to. It helps teachers:  

* develop their plans 
* engage with colleagues, senior leaders and governors about their plans 
* save time
* develop confidence

### Build in subject leadership time 

We set aside time for subject leaders to plan their curriculum.  

Our teachers have half a day every week to cover all the subjects they have to review. 

## Work together 

### Share resources 

We share resources within the school and across schools. We develop schemes of work with others. 

### Network 

We connect with teachers across the country through online platforms.  

For example, we joined local and national networks. We also created our own networks by reaching out to form partnerships of practice. 

### Pair up teachers  

We pair up teachers for planning, preparation, and assessment time. 

This allows them to collaborate and support each other.  

This is especially crucial for early career teachers (ECTs) and school-based teacher training colleagues.
