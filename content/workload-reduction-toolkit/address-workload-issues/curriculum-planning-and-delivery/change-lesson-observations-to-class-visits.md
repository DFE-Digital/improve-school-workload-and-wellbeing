## Background from Jo Summerfield, Headteacher

{inset-text}

In consultation with the staff, we decided to review our lesson observation format. The process was often stressful for colleagues due to the build-up prior to the observation, including anxiety, excessive and detailed lesson planning and a ‘them and us’ culture. Fundamentally, the pressure to perform ‘the perfect lesson’ was identified as adding to workload with no benefit to the quality of education provided to the children. 

The school therefore revised their approach, moving from formal lesson observations to an ‘open door’ policy where leaders regularly visit classrooms then share their feedback with the teacher later that day. Where possible, the leaders visit classes in pairs to ensure that there is peer on peer challenge around what has been seen.  

This change is about supporting everyone’s wellbeing, decreasing everyone’s workload and helping everyone develop.

## Create a culture of trust 

There needs to be a culture of trust that goes both ways: 

* the leadership team trust teachers to deliver high quality lessons without close, formal scrutiny 

* teachers trust that SLT are there to value what they do each and every day, support them and not to make unfair judgements 

* ‘a learning school’ culture becomes embedded: staff are open to feedback, want to improve their practice, know that their views are valued and want to try new things 

## Change formal observations to lesson visits 

Lesson observations have been replaced by informal lesson visits and this has created a permanent ’open door’ culture.  

### Be clear on why and when class visits happen 

SLT chooses one of the teacher’s standards as a focus for the next lesson visit, aiming to cover all standards throughout the year. There isn’t usually a specific curriculum focus. 

We limit the number of lesson visits to three per teacher a year. Other monitoring activities occur on a half-termly basis, to ensure leaders have a full picture of the quality of teaching provision.

Notice will be given before a fortnightly lesson visit cycle starts, and it will be on the school calendar. 

Teachers don’t usually know when leaders are coming in or what the focus is, so they don’t overprepare or tailor their teaching to specific criteria.  

If the timing isn’t appropriate, then SLT will arrange to come back another time. 

No lesson visits take place in the last week of any half term. 

### How class visits work 

Leaders divide up into pairs to walk around the school for about thirty minutes. They spend ten to fifteen minutes in each lesson and take minimal notes. 

Feedback is given to teachers the same day. The pairs change over the year so leaders can learn from each other as well as seeing different teachers each time. Not all classes might be seen every time, but the aim is for all classes to be seen during a lesson visit fortnight. Sometimes there will be an EYFS, KS1 or KS2 focus. 

All classrooms have an ’open door’ policy. Teachers and children are used to leaders popping in and out regularly, so it doesn’t feel like a big deal when they come in. 

### What happens in a class visit 

Leaders look at books, chat to children and get a feel for the teaching. They are looking for evidence of the chosen teachers’ standard. 

Leaders make a few notes if they want to, linked to the chosen teacher standard.

## Give fast and informal feedback 

Leaders give teachers feedback as soon as they can – this might be straight after the lesson visit or that afternoon. The idea is that the faster the feedback, the sooner the teacher can act upon it. 

The feedback is short and informal and leaders are expected to: 

* thank the teacher

* say something they liked

* suggest something to work on

* suggest an area of professional development for them to look into

As a staff we have agreed to do this by a quick email with a feedback document attached. 

Leaders can offer an informal follow-up chat, or the teacher can ask for a more in-depth conversation if they would find this useful. 

## Make exceptions when needed 

There are some situations where teachers will still have formal lesson observations. 

Early career teachers still have lesson observations as part of their induction. 

If a leader sees something concerning during a visit, for example, poor subject knowledge or serious behaviour management issues, they act upon it straight away. This involves chatting with the teacher to discuss how they move forward, or what support they need to improve.

At the next lesson visit, the leader will follow up to see if there has been an improvement. If there is still a concern, we introduce more formal lesson observations to offer support and monitor the teacher’s progress in this area. As soon as leaders see evidence that the problem has improved, they go back to normal lesson visits.

## Trial the approach and adapt 

Senior leadership need to make sure teachers still have a chance to shine. Ten minute lesson visits will only give a snapshot into teaching for each teacher and might mean that a ‘wow’ moment is missed. Allow time to visit another day and see it. 

We are trialling the whole approach before full implementation to allow time for any tweaks that are needed. All staff should feel happy with the process and confident that the system provides them with effective support and development within an open culture.
