        Audience
      </h2>

      <p>
        The presentation has been provided for senior leadership teams to run
        with the whole school, teams or departments.  
      </p>

      <p>
        It could also be an exercise just for senior leadership, with the
        results shared and discussed with staff. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7 govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
        Presentation length
      </h2>

      <p>
        The presentation should take 1 hour. You should also allocate time for
        the facilitator to prepare the session for use in your school.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7 govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
        How to run with your staff
      </h2>

      <p>
        You could complete the exercises individually or in teams, before
        discussing them together or communicating to the wider school.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Senior leadership teams are likely to want to oversee the process. They
        could also consider if it is more appropriate for another member of
        staff to facilitate the session and lead on follow-up, for example, a
        head of department. 
      </p>

      <p>
        You might also wish to consider asking somebody independent to
        facilitate the workshop to free up time to take part. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Provide a supportive environment for open and honest professional
        dialogue.
      </p>
