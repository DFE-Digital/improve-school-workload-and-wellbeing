        Impact and outcomes

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There were far more benefits to this system than drawbacks. There was a
        higher attendance from parents and the majority of stakeholders when
        questioned were keen to keep it post Covid. It did take a bit of
        adjusting for staff in that they needed to get straight to the important
        parts of the conversation as small talk simply ran the clock down. If
        introducing the system for the first time, it would be worth considering
        some training or run- throughs with staff just so they get a feel how to
        use the time productively.

        ‘I feel very strongly that it is much less stressful for all parties. It
        ensures all staff/parents stick to time meaning all those with an
        appointment do get a fair equal opportunity to talk. So much time is
        saved by not moving around so that 5 minutes is usually more than
        sufficient time for productive discussion.’ (PHGS classroom teacher)

## Background from Claire Willis, Assistant headteacher

{inset-text}
Prince Henry’s is a highly respected school within Leeds with an established
culture in which staff and pupils have excellent relationships based on mutual
respect. School leaders and governors are ambitious, and parents recognise the
quality of teaching their children are receiving and the strong behaviour
systems that are in place.

Pre-COVID 19, parents’ evenings followed the standard format of pre-booked face
to face conversations with parents. Had there been no pandemic, the process
would not have changed because parents reported they were happy with this
format. As circumstances changed, the school quickly began to explore how they
could ensure parents were kept up to date with their child’s performance,
thereby maintaining the very effective school to parent communication they had
established. We used an IT based system that enabled parents to book
appointments with those staff they wish to see at a time that suited their home
and work schedule, and this proved effective in reducing workload for staff as
well.

{/inset-text}

## What we did and why it works

We investigated a range of IT products, and finally bought into a commercial
cloud based program that facilitates an online video booking system. There are a
number of ways of doing this and it is up to an individual school to choose the
product that is best for them.

The system enables staff and parents to know when each appointment will start
and that it will finish on time through an on-screen countdown timer. Teachers
know when the appointment is coming to an end, unlike face to face parents’
evenings where one appointment rolls into someone else’s, resulting in the
following consultations often beginning on the wrong foot. This prevents
disgruntled parents who have been kept waiting and also the conflict of having
to dash around different areas of school for their different appointments. For
teaching staff, the new system enables appointments to transition smoothly from
one to the next as there is no logging in and out, just a seamless process.

This system also allows more than one parent to access to the same appointment
which is helpful where one parent is working or there is shared parenting. It
offers a more productive use of time and a more confidential experience.

## A 10 point plan for online parents’ evenings

1. Identify a product that offers flexibility in booking and hosting parents’
   evenings. Our product allows us to set up the evening, then parents book on
   independently and staff and parents can log in from any device on the evening.

2. Ensure this is up to date with accurate staff and student lists - taken from
   your Management Information System. Update this frequently.

3. Set up your event - assign the teaching staff to an evening, decide on the
   length of appointments - some systems allow you to have gaps between
   appointments. We initially tried with no gaps, but found this was very intense
   for staff, so used 1-2 minute breaks between appointments which worked better.

4. Consider whether any other staff should be added (e.g. pastoral staff) to the
   appointment schedule. If you decide against this, ensure you remind parents of
   how to access this support following the event. Here we found that the option
   to book follow-up phone calls after was more useful than seeing pastoral staff
   before academic staff.

5. Contact parents and invite them to make appointments using the system. This
   should generate an email to them confirming appointments have been booked.
   This gives parents control of the appointment times, which can result in gaps
   for some staff, but at least the gaps are clearly planned and timetabled in
   advance.

6. In the days before the event, email out an instruction sheet that explains
   how the software works, checks that can be made beforehand, who to contact for
   help, etc. Request staff familiarise themselves with the software.

7. Remind parents and staff to consider the appropriateness of their attire and
   online backgrounds.

8. Consider whether to allow staff to attend these meetings from home (we found
   that most staff are positive towards this, however, there are some who prefer
   to stay in school and we allow both options).

9. On the evening, staff and parents can simply find the email that confirms
   their appointments and click the links that take them to the meeting(s). Each
   appointment ends automatically and you are moved to the next one.

10. Monitor the attendance. With many products you can instantly see whether an
    appointment has been attended. If possible, have someone available by a phone
    and computer who can resolve any issues (often this may have been a technical
    glitch, and a rescheduled appointment can leave everyone happy).
