            How to use this section
          </h2>
          <p>
            You can use the resources as they are or adapt them to meet the
            needs of your school.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presentation is designed to enable safe discussion with your
            staff in a staff meeting or INSET day. You can use it to identify
            which issues with communications workload to prioritise, update,
            streamline or stop completely.
