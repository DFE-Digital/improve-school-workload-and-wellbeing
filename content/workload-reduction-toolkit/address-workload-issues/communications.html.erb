          How to use this section
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can use the resources as they are or adapt them to meet the
          needs of your school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presentation is designed to enable safe discussion with your
          staff in a staff meeting or INSET day. You can use it to identify
          which issues with communications workload to prioritise, update,
          streamline or stop completely.
