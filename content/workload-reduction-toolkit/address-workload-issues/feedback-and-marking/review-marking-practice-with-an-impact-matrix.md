        Impact and outcomes
      </h2>
      <p>
         Using the impact matrix to review marking practices at the City of
         Norwich School has meant that:
        <ul>
          <li>homework activities have been simplified and marking criteria removed</li>
          <li>mid-unit tests became shorter and more positively structured</li>
          <li>tasks became much easier to mark and celebrate</li>
       </ul>
      </p>

## Background from Joanne Philpott, Headteacher

{inset-text}

We developed a simple department activity to help prioritise and streamline
marking practice, whilst maintaining the quality of marking that makes it
meaningful and motivating. It was clear that our staff were not coping with
marking workloads and as consequence books were not marked effectively. The Head
of Science, Head of School and Assistant Headteacher sat together and worked to
create and complete the impact matrix.

## Using the impact matrix to review marking

The impact matrix can be downloaded and used to review your own practice or
approach to marking. It can be adapted as necessary for other tasks such as
planning, communications or data management. You can read more about The City of
Norwich Schoolâ€™s approach to tackling workload in their
