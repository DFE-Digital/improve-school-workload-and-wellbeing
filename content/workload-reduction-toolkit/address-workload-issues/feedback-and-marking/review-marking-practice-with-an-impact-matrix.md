          Using the impact matrix to review marking practices at the City of Norwich School has meant that: 
          <li>homework activities have been simplified and marking criteria removed</li> 
          <li>mid-unit tests became shorter and more positively structured</li>
          <li>tasks became much easier to mark and celebrate</li> 
       </ul>

## Background from Joanne Philpott, Headteacher

{inset-text}

We developed a simple department activity to help prioritise and streamline marking practice, whilst maintaining the quality of marking that makes it meaningful and motivating. It was clear that our staff were not coping with marking workloads and as consequence books were not marked effectively. The Head of Science, Head of School and Assistant Headteacher sat together and worked to create and complete the impact matrix.

## Using the impact matrix to review marking 

The impact matrix can be downloaded and used to review your own practice or approach to marking. It can be adapted as necessary for other tasks such as planning, communications or data management. You can read more about The City of Norwich Schoolâ€™s approach to tackling workload in their [blog](https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/19/using-curriculum-area-development-time-to-reduce-teacher-workload/).
