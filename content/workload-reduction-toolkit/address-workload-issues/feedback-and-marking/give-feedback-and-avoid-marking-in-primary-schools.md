## Background from INSERT-CONTACT-NAME

{inset-text}

The sole focus of feedback is to further a child’s learning. Feedback must empower a child to take responsibility for improving their own work. Adults should not take this responsibility away from the child by doing the hard work for them (for example, making corrections to spellings, punctuation, or grammar). If we give any written feedback, this is to help the pupil - not to satisfy external inspection.

## Types of feedback 

### Immediate feedback  

Immediate feedback: 
* takes place during a lesson with individuals, groups or a whole class 
* includes formative assessment from the teacher or teaching assistant, for example using the whiteboard, book work or verbal answers 
* is often given verbally to pupils for immediate action and may redirect the focus of teaching or the task 
* praises effort and contributions 

To demonstrate how immediate feedback is helping pupils to progress, you can use evidence such as: 
* lesson observations 
* learning walks 

### Responsive (catch-up) feedback  

Responsive feedback: 
* takes place after the lesson or activity with individuals or groups 
* addresses knowledge from the lesson or activity or missing prior knowledge 
* is often given verbally with time to rehearse knowledge 
* is usually delivered by a teaching assistant based on guidance from the teacher  

An element of the child’s responses to feedback is recorded in their workbooks to show progress over time. 

To demonstrate how responsive feedback is helping pupils to progress, you can use evidence such as: 
* catch-up observations 
* learning walks 
* feedback grids 
* book looks 

### Summary (feed-forward) feedback 

Summary feedback: 
* involves reading or looking at the work of all pupils at the end of a lesson or unit 
* identifies and addresses strengths or misconceptions of the class or group 
* takes place during the following lesson 
* allocates time for editing based on feedback or knowledge rehearsal 
* may involve peer support or support from a teaching assistant 
* may be delivered by the teacher or a teaching assistant 

To demonstrate how responsive feedback is helping pupils to progress, you can use evidence such as: 
* planning looks 
* lesson observations 
* learning walks  
* book looks
