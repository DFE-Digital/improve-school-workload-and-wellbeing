  <p>
      Setting out a clear and consistent approach to behaviour management can
      reduce workload.
  </p>
  <p>
    It enables teachers to simply teach, rather than spend time dealing with
    low level disruption.

## Background from Chris Gibson, Deputy Headteacher

{inset-text}

We set out a clear and consistent approach to behaviour management because low
level disruption and poor behaviour was having a negative impact on student
outcomes, staff and pupil wellbeing and staff workload.

It was very difficult for departments and staff to plan and deliver high quality
lessons while dealing with behaviour.

We believe that senior leadership and pastoral support teams should deal with
behaviour and that teachers should follow behaviour protocols consistently. When
staff are consistent, pupils are quicker to accept it and move on.

No one enters teaching because they love to tell students to sit down or stop
calling out. But learning does not happen without a foundation of clear
expectations.

## Our approach to behaviour management

Our behaviour protocol sets out:

- clear expectations for pupils in lessons and around school

- routines for lessons, breaks and lunchtimes - so that our 2 sites are
  consistent

- that staff can quickly and easily record behaviour issues using our school
  information behaviour management system (SIMS)

- that leadership and pastoral staff are visible during lessons, breaks and
  lunchtimes - we set up systems so that staff can easily call for help

- what ‘good behaviour’ means, so that everyone can model it and students can be
  praised for it

- how staff use consequence codes such as C1, C2 and C3 – we review this
  regularly with staff and explain it to students, parents and carers so that
  they understand our expectations

- how to articulate consequences when they’re issued

- how we monitor consequences to support students and ensure we’re consistent
  across the school

- that senior leadership, heads of year and pastoral support teams deal with
  queries from parents and carers regarding any consequences

- the use of a centralised detention system so departments and teaching staff do
  not need to run their own – instead, non-teaching members supervise detentions

- that parents and carers can track the number of achievement and behaviour
  points issued to their child - we use regular reports using SIMS and the SIMS
  Parent App

- that regular feedback is given to year groups and houses about the number of
  achievement and behaviour points issued – we generate this using SIMS

- how pupils can get house points if they receive more points for achievement
  than for behaviour issues

- that we use regular feedback and external reviews to evaluate our behaviour
  protocols and how they’ve evolved over the last 3 years
