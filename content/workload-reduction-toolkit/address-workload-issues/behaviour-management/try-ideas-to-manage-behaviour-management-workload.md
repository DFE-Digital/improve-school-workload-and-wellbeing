      <p>
        We made these changes to enable every teacher to become highly
        effective by:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ensuring every teacher has time to focus on what is important -
            planning, teaching and feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            believing in simplicity, always taking the shortest route and aiming
            for maximum impact on student learning with minimal workload for
            staff
          </li>
          <li>
            continuously reviewing and evaluating our systems in order to
            support all staff to achieve a healthy work life balance

## Background from Ruth Allen, Deputy Headteacher

{inset-text}

At King Charles I School we know that teaching is exhilarating and rewarding,
but recognise that it can also be exhausting. We understand that time is
precious and that tired teachers do not make effective teachers. Our aim is for
staff to not have to take work home.

## 8 ways that we manage behaviour management workload

1. Everyone has the highest expectations of behaviour, with all staff (not just
   teaching staff) reinforcing those expectations.

2. A clear system of consequences or sanctions which is applied consistently so
   staff don’t have battles with students. Simple and quick logging of the
   consequences/sanctions.

3. Clear and robust behaviour systems that underpins impeccable behaviour, so
   you are free to teach.

4. Centralised after school detentions for all behaviour and homework issues to
   ease the pressure at break, lunch and after school.

5. No teachers have to make phone calls to parents or carers regarding
   behaviour. The robust behaviour systems ensure teachers can get on with
   teaching.

6. The senior leadership team (SLT) are very visible and all staff ‘own’ their
   corridors. Staff and students know that they’ll never walk alone.

7. The SLT run break and lunch time duties every day so that behaviour in
   unstructured time does not affect the smooth running of lessons.

8. Staff do not need to do any lunch duties. If they want to do one, then we
   will pay them or pay for their lunch.
