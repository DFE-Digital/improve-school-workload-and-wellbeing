## Audience

This resource has been provided to support senior leadership teams to run a
session with the whole school, teams or departments, and governors where
appropriate.

## Presentation length

1 hour. Time should also be allocated for the facilitator to enable
them to effectively prepare the session for use in your school.

## How to run with your staff

The presentation is designed to help senior leadership teams and teaching staff
consider the factors that build and maintain a positive school culture. This
includes preventing classroom disruption and supporting good discipline, which
leads to a reduction in workload related to behaviour management. It is also
relevant to governing boards as they have a role in overseeing the school
behaviour policy.

Use the presentation:

- to familiarise yourself with examples of different approaches to behaviour
  management
- to discuss in a supportive and open environment how the schoolâ€™s behaviour
  policy is applied and whether processes could be streamlined to
  reduce workload
- in a way that is most useful for you. For example you might want to have
  discussions as a whole school, team, department or leadership team, liaising
  with governing boards.

You might want to run the workshop as part of a whole school INSET following an
initial discussion with governors. You could also complete the exercises
individually or in teams, before discussing them together or communicating to
the wider school.

There is a discussion template which could also serve as a record of the actions
to be taken forward.

Provide a supportive environment for open and honest professional dialogue.
