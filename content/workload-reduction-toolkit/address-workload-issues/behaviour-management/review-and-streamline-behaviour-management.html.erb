          How to run with your staff
        </h2>

        <p>
          The presentation is designed to help senior leadership teams and
          teaching staff consider the factors that build and maintain a school
          culture which prevents classroom disruption, supports good discipline,
          and leads to a reduction in workload related to behaviour management.
          It is also relevant to governing boards as they have a role in
          overseeing the school behaviour policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the presentation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              to familiarise yourself with examples of different approaches to
              behaviour management
            </li>
            <li>
              to discuss in a supportive and open environment how the schoolâ€™s
              behaviour policy is applied and whether processes could be
              streamlined to reduce workload
            </li>
            <li>
              in a way that is most useful for you, for example you might want
              to have discussions as a whole school, team, department or
              leadership team, liaising with governing boards.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          You might want to run the workshop as part of a whole school INSET
          following an initial discussion with governors. Or you could complete
          the exercises individually or in teams, before discussing them
          together or communicating to the wider school.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a discussion template which could also serve as a record of
          the actions to be taken forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide a supportive environment for open and honest professional
          dialogue.
