    Impact and outcomes
  </h2>
  <p>
    A centralised system to record pupil behaviour can help you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      identify issues with behaviour
    </li>
    <li>
      intervene where necessary
    </li>
    <li>
      reward good behaviour
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It also saves time and reduces paperwork, letting you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      record information straight away
    </li>
    <li>
      analyse behaviour regularly
    </li>
  </ul>

## Background from Jason Ashley, Headteacher

{inset-text}

At Redbridge we set up a centralised system to record behaviour incidents, as
part of our work to transform the culture of behaviour management in the school.
This has reduced workload and helped us to apply behaviour policy consistently.

## Set up your system

### 1. Agree on its purpose and how it will be used

Our system helps us to:

- see where disruption occurs, such as in a science classroom

- reward good behaviour

It also helps us to:

- analyse behaviour and rewards over time - for example, you can see where
  behaviour issues spike

- share findings â€“ for example, we can generate graphs for use in assemblies

It also flags when to notify parents, carers, tutors or senior leadership about
behaviour.

These examples show the format and content typically included in behaviour and
achievement reports, although this may differ by the digital solution chosen.

### 2. Choose your digital solution

We use SIMS to record behaviour information, but you can choose a digital
solution that works for you.

If you have a staff member who is already familiar with your chosen digital
solution, they can help promote the system in your school.

Alternatively, a member of staff could attend training.

### 3. Decide how to categorise behaviour

We use points and colours to categorise behaviour. For example:

- 5 points (gold) for outstanding behaviour

- 2 points (green) for good behaviour

- minus one point (amber) for minor concern, such as homework

- minus 2 points (red) for poor behaviour, particularly if repeated 3 times

- minus 3 points (purple) for serious behaviour incidents

We use 2 and 5 points for positive behaviours to help balance out minus points.

### 4. Train your staff to use the system

At Redbridge, staff can:

- give pupils points during lessons and transitions such as breaks and
  lunchtimes

- generate reports for individual pupils, classes or groups

Think about the roles and responsibilities for different staff members such as
tutors, teachers and heads of departments. For example, a pastoral leader could
run a regular report for a year group.

### 5. Decide the purpose of reports and how often they should be used

Behaviour reports can be used to create a timeline that shows spikes in pupil
behaviour or rewards. They can be generated as often as required, such as weekly
or every half-term, and used to create lists or graphs for assemblies.

Some management information systems also include a messaging system that can
flag important messages to parents and carers, form tutors or senior leaders.
