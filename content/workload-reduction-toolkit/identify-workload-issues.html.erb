            <p>
              You can choose the resources you want to use and adapt them for your
              school context. They will help you:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>identify the causes of the biggest workload issues</li>
                <li>understand how your staff feel about workload</li>
                <li>
                  prioritise
                  <a href="<%= @base_url %>/workload-reduction-toolkit/address-workload-issues" class="govuk-link">specific workload areas</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              As a senior leadership team, decide whether you will address
              workload across the whole school, by department or in individual
              teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regularly reviewing workload with all your staff will help you to
              understand workload issues and evaluate the impact you are having.
            </p>
