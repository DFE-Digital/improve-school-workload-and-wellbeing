# How the toolkit was made and tested

The toolkit is a set of workload reduction resources produced by school leaders, for school leaders. They have been
designed to support what you are already doing and can be adapted to work in your school.

<hr class="section-break--thin"></hr>

## Background to the toolkit

This toolkit is part of DfE's action to support schools to reduce workload and address the causes of excessive workload
at a national level.

It builds on the principles of the Workload Advisory Group report
[Making data work](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response)
and three independent reports on marking, planning and resources and data management:

- [Data Management Review Group report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-data-management-review-group-report)
- [Marking Policy Review Group report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-marking-policy-review-group-report)
- [Planning and Resources Group report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-planning-and-resources-group-report)

DfE has also consulted and engaged with organisations to help reduce workload in schools, including:

- Ofsted
- the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)
- Community, Education and Early Years (formerly Voice the Union)
- the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT)
- NASUWT, The Teachersâ€™ Union
- the National Education Union (NEU)

## Evidence for the toolkit

The resources in the toolkit were provided by school leaders and have been tested with a range of schools across England.

Schools using them in a project with the
[Teaching Schools Council and Education Development Trust](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teacher-workload-education-development-trust-report) saw:

- significantly reduced teacher time on targeted tasks
- improvements in overall teacher wellbeing
- constant or improved pupil attainment and progress
