      <p>
        We established a wellbeing committee who created a report on staff
        wellbeing which was shared with governors and staff. The report included
        quantitative data on staff absence rates which we try to benchmark
        against national data. We use this, as well as qualitative data from our
        staff wellbeing survey, to give an indication of staff wellbeing to
        governors.

      <p>
        We review the committee terms of reference annually. They were
        introduced to give clear purpose to the work of the committee so that it
        did not simply become a ‘talking shop’.
      </p>
      <p>
        All documentation, including minutes of meetings, is freely available to
        all staff via our intranet. We make this transparent to increase
        confidence, trust and accountability in what we seek to do.

## Background from Neil Cully, Headteacher

{inset-text}

In the last 3 years we have directed our focus more specifically to identifying
issues around staff wellbeing that we feel we have some control over and
therefore can do something about.

We created a committee to improve staff wellbeing. The committee is made up of
volunteers who meet once every half term. Their focus has shifted towards
creating the annual workload survey, analysing its results and formulating an
action plan. They also consider issues raised by members of staff. We seek to
make sure that the committee is representative of the different teams of staff
within the school.

## 1. Choose who should be on the committee

Create a committee comprised of leadership team members and representatives from
all staff.

Decide who will chair it.

## 2. Agree what the committee should do

The aim of the committee is to promote and ensure the wellbeing of all employees
at the school. They could advise the leadership team on all matters relating to
wellbeing within the school and report to governors termly.

For example, the committee could:

- distribute a survey to monitor wellbeing

- identify issues that challenge the wellbeing of the staff

- communicate issues to the leadership team and governors, suggesting ways to
  resolve them

- evaluate the impact of any intervention to resolve wellbeing issues

- review the school’s wellbeing documentation at the start of each academic year

- inform staff of wellbeing initiatives via the wellbeing notice board in the
  staff room, the bulletin and staff meetings (when appropriate)

## 3. Agree when and how the committee will meet

The full committee could meet at least once per half term.

A meeting schedule of these meetings and the membership of the committee could
be regularly published to all staff.

Additional meetings may be held for teachers and support staff committee
members, also once per term, or by agreement between the chair and the staff
representatives where circumstances warrant it.

Notice of meetings could be advertised in advance so that staff can take any
issues to their representative for discussion.

## 4. Plan appropriate training

The committee should ensure that its members receive appropriate training to
undertake their duties.

## 5. Review the committee

The committee, and its terms of reference, will be reviewed at the first meeting
of each autumn term and any proposed and agreed changes should go to the full
governing body.
