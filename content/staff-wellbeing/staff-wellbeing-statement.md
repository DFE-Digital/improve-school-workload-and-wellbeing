## Background from HR Manager Rachel Boyall

{inset-text}

The staff wellbeing statement outlined below was developed by our wellbeing focus group. In addition to the statement, the focus group: 

* offers support to staff 

* seeks feedback on how staff are feeling 

* shares resources 

* looks for ways to boost morale 

* uses staff absence to measure wellbeing

## Our principles 

These principles are the cornerstone of our approach to wellbeing at St Peter’s: 

* because we care 

* because everyone matters 

* together we can make a difference 

* this is worth it 

* we are worth it  

* you are worth it 

## Staff wellbeing statement 

St Peter’s recognises its responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of its employees, and understands that wellbeing and performance are linked. We are committed to fostering a culture of co-operation, trust and mutual respect, where all individuals are treated with dignity, and can work at their optimum level.   

We recognise that work-related stress has a negative impact on employees’ wellbeing and that it can take many forms, so it needs to be carefully monitored and addressed at an organisational level.  

At St Peter’s we: 

* carefully plan and agree work-life balance solutions including flexible working practices where possible and appropriate 

* ensure that the right people are recruited to the right jobs and that a good match is obtained between individuals recruited and job descriptions/specifications 

* manage pressures which may affect employees, including the impact of workload, and anticipate likely problems, taking action to reduce the effects of these pressures where possible 

* pay attention to any changes in employee performance or behaviour and promote sympathetic alertness to employees who show signs of being under stress   

* create opportunities for employees to discuss concerns and enable employees to do so in a supportive environment, through one-to-one meetings and feedback sessions 

* provide an Employment Assistant Programme (EAP), which offers a free 24-hour counselling service 

* put in place procedures for line managers to address concerns or absence due to work related stress 

* provide Occupational Health support to employees where appropriate   

* carry out a risk assessment, where necessary, and especially when concerns have been raised, as soon as possible   

* ensure that when staff are absent, proportionate, and supportive contact is maintained with them, at a mutually agreed frequency 

* establish a return-to-work policy that is supportive of employee  

We ask employees to:   

* inform the organisation if they believe work or the work environment poses a risk to their health 

* seek support or help when they think they are experiencing a problem at the earliest opportunity to ensure effective strategies can be implemented 

* act in a manner that respects the health and safety needs of themselves and others whilst in the workplace 

* assist in the development of good practice and aim to not, through their actions or omissions, create unnecessary work for themselves or colleagues 

* treat colleagues and all other persons whom they interact with during the course of their work with consideration, respect and dignity 

* treat in confidence any health-related information disclosed by an employee during discussions with managers or the occupational health service 

* take responsibility for managing their own health and wellbeing outside of work
