## Background from Carolyn Morgan, CEO

{inset-text}

It is clear from national surveys and Ascent Trust’s own fact finding, that excessive workload is a major obstacle to schools across the country being able to successfully recruit and retain the best teachers and support staff.  

We developed our academy trust workload agreement to support better recruitment and retention of teachers and support staff.

## Ensuring fair and reasonable workload 

Ascent Trust ensures fair and reasonable workload through:  

* the executive leadership team’s commitment to reducing work hours (above and beyond 1265) for all teachers and a Trust review of TA contractual hours and duties  

* the appraisal of all staff should include a review of workload with a supporting action in order to ensure employers exercise their duty of care to employees with regard to workload, including heads of academy 

* a total review of the Educational Health Care Plan (EHCP) reports and meetings, with Ascent (rather than individual LA) providing the lead on systems and procedures 

* a working party to review curriculum planning systems across the trust with the intention of reducing workload 

* ensuring that before any new trust policies, reports or initiatives are introduced, Ascent completes a workload impact assessment to ensure there is no negative effect on workload 

* ensuring that for non-teaching staff, the requirements of policies are reasonably deliverable within contracted hours 

* regularly reviewing the workload charter with all staff 

Individual academies within the trust ensure fair and reasonable workload through: 

* Senior Leadership Team (SLT) stating and planning the allocation of directed time with staff  

* the publishing and adhering to termly calendars where possible 

* a guarantee from SLT to staff that any major changes initiated by the Trust will be planned on an annual basis and shared with staff via the Academy Improvement Plan (AIP)  

* clear expectations policies for marking, feedback and assessment 

* SLT and business support review of admin support needed in order to reduce admin duties currently undertaken by teachers
