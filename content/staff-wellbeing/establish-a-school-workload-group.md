            the amount of data being gathered was reduced, and therefore the time being spent by staff inputting it without any detrimental impact on pupil outcomes

          <li>
          staff have become more confident in the use of IT and feel they can work more efficiently

## Background from Richard Kearsey, CEO

Baylis Court School set up a working group to address staff workload. This was following the involvement of the executive headteacher in the independent teacher workload review groups for data management.

## Why we set up a workload group 

School leaders recognised that they needed to better understand the workload of teaching staff. Leaders wanted to develop possible strategies that would reduce workload for teachers without increasing it for others.  

The group was chaired by a member of the senior leadership team to ensure that there was direct feedback from the group to senior leaders of the school. 

## How we established our workload group 

### Decide on the purpose of the group 

For example, to receive feedback on a termly basis about staff workload, and recommendations for colleagues and senior leadership to support staff to manage this.  

### Decide members of the group 

Membership should be representative of staff, and include a range of experience, for example: 

* NQTs 

* teachers 2/3 years into teaching 

* staff who have taught in at least one other school 

* middle leaders – both pastoral and academic 

* staff who have previously worked outside of teaching 

* support staff 

* union representatives 

### Identify priorities of the group 

Identify priorities to support staff in managing workload, for example: 

* time taken up by replying to e-mail and face-to-face requests for information 

* further training on ‘remote access’ for staff 

* perceived excessive marking burden 

* relevance of some weekly CPD sessions for all staff 

* lack of clarity about how staff are meant to spend their directed time 

* the imbalance between all-staff meetings, department time and individual time 

* scheduling of assessment weeks adjacent to other tasks that may cause more workload, for example, book scrutiny, creating excessive workload at key points each half term 

* excessive volume of data entry required due to assessment changes 

* teachers having to provide work for students removed from lessons 

## Develop an action plan 

Develop an action plan and disseminate this to staff. Examples of actions: 

* review the school’s draft teaching and learning calendar, and make recommendations to support reduction of ‘pressure points’ 

* produce a weekly staff bulletin, to better support communication with staff and reduce the number of meetings and separate emails   

* implement relevant recommendations from the DfE, for example, reduction of the number of data collection points per academic year, ensuring that these were purposeful and minimising marking burdens 

* effective training for staff on use of IT systems 

Staff working on these actions, for example, producing the bulletin, should be freed up from other tasks where appropriate. 

## Evaluate the impact of the group 

Evaluate the ongoing impact of the group and share findings with staff.  

You could group representatives to run an INSET session to feed back on the work and impact of the group and seek further recommendations.
