## Background from  Chris Deller, headteacher and Laura Fordham, SLT and Wellbeing Lead 

{inset-text}

Wellbeing is at the centre of everything we do. Three years ago we had a high staff turnover, a poor school culture of low expectations and low aspirations and a falling roll. Three years on, we have a very low staff turnover, an increased roll in year 7 and waiting lists in every year group.  

 We have transformed our wider community’s perception of our school. The main platform for this change has been a considerable shift in our focus to ensuring student and staff wellbeing is at our core, with open communication to all stakeholders, regular staff consultations and a drive to improve educational standards for students in our school.   

 The Trust supports individual schools to develop wellbeing strategies so that they are focused on the needs of each school as opposed to a generic approach across the Trust.

## Three ways to communicate to improve staff retention 

### Regular staff consultations 

Staff consultations relating to staff wellness happen regularly and all staff are invited to contribute ideas. Staff are involved in whole school decisions and have an opportunity to contribute their opinions via staff voice tools. 

### Form a wellbeing committee 

The wellbeing committee comprises staff members and representatives from all departments that hold a range of positions within the Academy. The central aim of the committee is to promote and ensure the wellbeing of all employees at the Academy. The committee will advise the Leadership Team on all matters relating to wellbeing and report to Governors. 

The full committee will meet at least once per half term.  A meeting schedule of these meetings and the membership of the committee will be regularly published to all staff.  

The wellbeing committee will: 

* evaluate the impact of any intervention to resolve wellbeing issues 

* coordinate termly wellbeing weeks 

* inform staff of wellbeing initiatives via the wellbeing notice board the monthly BA Wellbeing Newsletter and staff meetings (when appropriate) 

### Set up a working group 

The workload group will be formed with a different group of staff each term that will meet about staff workload and will make recommendations for colleagues and senior leadership to support staff to manage this.  

The group will be representative of staff, and include a range of experience, for example:  

* Early Career Teachers (ECTs)  

* staff who have taught in at least one other school 

* middle leaders – both pastoral and academic 

* staff who have previously worked outside of teaching 

* support staff 

The workload group will identify priorities to support staff in managing workload and this will be disseminated to staff.
