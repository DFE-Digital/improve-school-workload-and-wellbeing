## Background from Chris Deller, Headteacher and Laura Fordham, senior leader and Wellbeing Lead

{inset-text}

Wellbeing is at the centre of everything we do. Three years ago, we had a high staff turnover, a poor school culture of low expectations, low aspirations and a falling roll. Now we have lower staff turnover, an increased roll in year 7 and waiting lists in every year group. We have also transformed our wider community’s perception of our school.

The main platform for these changes has been:

- a considerable shift in our focus, ensuring student and staff wellbeing is at our core

- open communication to all stakeholders

- regular staff consultations

- a drive to improve educational standards for students in our school

Bedford Academy is part of the HEART Academies Trust. The Trust supports individual schools to develop wellbeing strategies that are focused on their own needs, as opposed to a generic approach across the Trust.

## Our wellbeing and workload charter

We ensure staff have time to focus on what’s important - planning, teaching and feedback. We continuously review and evaluate our systems to support all staff to achieve a healthy work-life balance.

### Supporting the whole school

The Bedford Academy (BA) calendar is published in advance and created alongside middle leaders to avoid pinch points.

There is an email protocol that staff are not expected to check or send emails after 6pm.

Staff can request one morning or afternoon paid family leave via the headteacher for a variety of occasions, such as their children’s sports days. This will be permitted dependent on any implications of staff cover.

A culture of peer-to-peer praise is built in.

Staff receive training built around the significant impact a line manager can have on wellbeing. For example, supporting continuing professional development needs, monitoring workload, celebrating success and developing a positive mindset.

### Supporting staff with pastoral responsibilities

Simple and quick logging of student praise points and demerits is in place. Parents have access to live updates from their smart phone or through emails.

Staff receive training for managing low level disruption and implementing and monitoring interventions on Epraise.

The senior leadership team (SLT) and pastoral staff are highly visible during all lessons, breaks and lunch times. This creates a supportive and non-judgemental culture across the school.

A system is in place for staff to call for support when necessary, or when school expectations need re-affirming.

The ‘BA Way’ provides clarity on the expectations for positive behaviours and attitudes. This forms the basis of our whole school standards and is displayed clearly in every room.

### Supporting staff with planning and assessment

Collaborative planning time enables teachers to discuss and share best practice centrally, to stop ‘reinventing the wheel’.

Staff departments, where possible, have preparation, planning and assessment time (PPA) together to allow for collaborative planning.

The feedback policy enables marking to be manageable. Teachers respond to long journey questions, and students peer and self-mark short journey questions to ensure feedback isn’t onerous.

There are no detailed written reports to parents or carers.

There are only 4 data collections per year.

### Offering high quality continuing professional development (CPD)

Staff are offered the opportunity to have a career aspiration discussion with the headteacher. All new staff have a scheduled meeting once a term in their first year.

Leadership positions are developed at all levels across the Trust, with middle leaders shadowing senior leaders, teachers shadowing their middle leaders and so on.

Staff have the opportunity to participate in a coaching session with a member of school staff who has been fully trained as a coach.

Staff have access to a range of high quality CPD pathways linked to different stages of career progression.

Training is offered to Learning Support Assistants (LSAs) and associate teachers that want to progress to qualified teacher status, where appropriate. We succession plan for unqualified teachers, encouraging applications from anyone that has a degree and might be interested in teaching longer term.

Training for middle and senior leaders happens to ensure meeting and CPD time is used as productively as possible. We focus on ‘how’ to facilitate innovatively asnd opposed to just ‘what’ to deliver.

Targeted support plans are in place for teachers who need it. The aim here is always to highlight strengths and build on inconsistencies, not to demotivate or identify weaknesses.

We offer an exceptional Early Career Teacher (ECT) programme, with dedicated mentors that receive bespoke training on how to be effective mentors and observers.

We train middle and senior leaders to provide effective and constructive feedback that is modelled around powerful action steps. This is bespoke and tailored to the individual’s needs.

ECTs follow the Early Career Framework. Tand there is an additional developmental package for those in their third year that allows them to explore other subject areas if they wish to do so.

### Ensuring line manager’s support wellbeing

A line manager plays an important role in promoting a productive workplace and supportive environment.

We encourage line managers to create a positive culture by:

- building a culture where it’s the norm to say ‘thank you’ to people for the work they’ve done - ideas are welcomed and good practice is acknowledged

- developing an ethos where staff know it’s fine to talk about wellbeing

- supporting staff with manageable workload ideas

- being positive and supportive in conversations

- exploring issues and how you can help with solutions

- reassuring your staff that your door is always open

- providing time and resources for professional development

- seeking opportunities for peer collaboration

- understanding strengths and weaknesses

- following up on actions in a timely way to continue to build trust

### Providing extras to staff

Cereal, tea and coffee is provided free of charge in the atrium.

Refreshments are provided before parents’ evenings.

We have weekly staff nominations for thanks and an ‘above and beyond’ award, where our headteacher buys a staff member lunch.

Regular staff social events outside of school are scheduled.

BA termly wellbeing weeks consist of a carousel of staff mindfulness, relaxation and managing stress sessions.

Shared breakfast and lunches with staff and students in the restaurant builds on connecting relationships.

A monthly BA Wellbeing Newsletter is compiled with wellbeing and self-care tips.

A DEAR (Drop Everything and Read) programme factors in mindfulness for the students and staff.

The ‘headspace’ room can be booked and is an appealing and comfortable place to take some time out. There are useful information leaflets from external organisations in the room to support physical and emotional wellbeing.

All BA staff have access to the Employee Assistance Programme and a range of other benefits provided by the Trust.
