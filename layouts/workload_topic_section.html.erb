              The presentation is designed to enable safe discussion with your
              staff in a staff meeting or INSET day. You can use it to identify
              which issues with <%= @item[:title].downcase %> workload to
              prioritise, update, streamline or stop completely.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also read case studies and see examples of how other schools
              have reduced <%= @item[:title].downcase %> workload.
