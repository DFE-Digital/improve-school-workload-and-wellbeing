# GitHub Pull Request (PR) Review Guide for Non-Developers

Welcome to our quick guide on how to review Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub. This guide is tailored for non-dev team members to ensure everyone can contribute to improving our project.

## How to Suggest Changes on Specific Lines

1. **Open the PR**: Navigate to the Pull Request you want to review.
2. **Find the file change**: Click on the `Files changed` tab to see the list of changes.
3. **Comment on a line**: Hover over the line number you wish to comment on; a blue `+` icon will appear. Click it to open a comment box.
4. **Suggest a specific change**:
   - Type your comment or suggestion.
   - To suggest an exact change, click the `+/-` icon in the comment toolbar to insert a suggestion block.
   - Edit the text within the suggestion block to reflect your suggested change.
5. **Submit review comment**: Once you're done, click `Start a review`. You can add more comments or suggestions before finalising your review.

## How to Leave General Comments

1. **Open the PR**: Go to the Pull Request you're reviewing.
2. **Leave a comment**:
   - For general comments, use the main comment box at the bottom of the `Conversation` tab.
   - For file-specific comments without suggesting changes, use the comment box as described in the previous section, but without adding a suggestion block.
3. **Submit your comment**: Click `Comment` to post it.

## Checking Links in the PR

1. **Access the deployed preview**: Look for the Netlify bot comment in the `Conversation` tab of the PR. It should provide a link to the deployed preview of the changes.
2. **Test the links**: Click through all the links in the deployed preview to ensure they work correctly. Pay special attention to new resources or modified links.
3. **Check resources are linked correctly**: Make sure any new resources are linked to both on the staff wellbeing page or the workload reduction toolkit **and** the appropriate explore resources section.
## Consider Mobile Responsiveness

To ensure that changes look good and work well on mobile devices:

1. **Find the Netlify bot comment**: In the `Conversation` tab of the PR, locate the comment made by the Netlify bot.
   Click on "Preview on mobile > Toggle QR code" and it should reveal a QR code linked to the deployed preview of the changes.
2. **Scan the QR code**: Use your mobile device to scan the QR code. This will open the deployed preview of the PR changes on your device.
3. **Test on your device**: Interact with the website on your mobile device. Check that the content is easily readable, links and buttons are easily tappable, and the layout adjusts properly to the smaller screen size without issues.

Remember, ensuring mobile responsiveness is crucial as a significant portion of users access websites through mobile devices.

## Finalising Your Review

- Once you've completed all your checks and comments, go to the `Files changed` tab and click on `Review changes`.
- Choose one of the options (`Comment`, `Approve`, or `Request changes`) based on your review, add a summary of your review, and then submit it.
